# Repository for Machine Learning Projects

This repository is meant to keep track of projects on my road to learning Machine Learning.

There are three folders for projects:

* **Classification**

	Contains 2 projects:
	1. **projectIris**: quick classification study for the Iris data set. I use different models and compare performance using 'accuracy' score.
	2. **projectHeartDisease**: The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). Different models are used to improve accuracy.


* **Clustering**
	Contains 2 projects:
	1. **projectWine**: K-Means clustering with the wine dataset preloaded in scikit-learn.
	2. **projectPokemon**: EDA training and clustering with Pok√©mon dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420).


* **Regression**:
	Contains 2 projects:
	1. **projectBoston**: linear regression study using the boston dataset preloaded in scikit-learn. Comparing MSE between single and multivariate model.
	2. **projectBulldozer**: time series analysis problem with dataset from [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation)
	3. **projectBikeSeoul**: This project uses a [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand) from the UCI repository containing information on the number of rented bikes in Seoul by hour from 01/12/2017 to 30/11/2018. A lot of weather information was also collected fro each hour of this period. Objective is to predict the number of bikes rented for each hour.

This file will be updated as more projects are included.

* **COMMENT ON projectBulldozer**: the input data is larger than 100MB (limit for github). So, to run locally, download files `TrainAndValid.csv` and `Test.csv` from [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).

Comments and criticism are welcome!
