# Repository for Machine Learning Projects

This repository is meant to keep track of projects on my road to learning Machine Learning.

There are three folders for projects:

* **Classification**

	Contains 2 projects:
	1. **projectIris**: quick classification study for the Iris data set. I use different models and compare performance using 'accuracy' score.
	2. **projectHeartDisease**: The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). Different models are used to improve accuracy.


* **Clustering**
	Contains 2 projects:
	1. **projectWine**: K-Means clustering with the wine dataset preloaded in scikit-learn.
	2. **projectPokemon**: EDA training and clustering with Pok√©mon dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420).


* **Regression**:
	Contains 2 projects:
	1. **projectBoston**: linear regression study using the boston dataset preloaded in scikit-learn. Comparing MSE between single and multivariate model.
	2. **projectBulldozer**: time series analysis problem with dataset from [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation)

This file will be updated as more projects are included.

* **COMMENT ON projectBulldozer**: the input data is larger than 100MB (limit for github). So, to run locally, download files `TrainAndValid.csv` and "Test.csv" from [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).

Comments and criticism are welcome!
